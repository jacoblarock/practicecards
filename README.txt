BUILDING
In Linux/MacOS, practicecards can be built by running the make.sh script.
This will create two directories in the parent directory (outside of
practicecards) build and dist. The finished executable is in dist unter main.
Helper files/pages will also be copied

In Windows this is analog and can be triggered with the make.bat script.

The data for the questions is stored locally in ".data" files in the same
directory as main.
